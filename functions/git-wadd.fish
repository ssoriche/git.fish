function git-wadd --description "Create a new git worktree and branch"
    # Git Worktree Add - Creates a new worktree with an optional branch
    #
    # SYNOPSIS
    #   git-wadd [OPTIONS] <worktree-name> [branch-name] [git-worktree-options...]
    #   git wadd [OPTIONS] <worktree-name> [branch-name] [git-worktree-options...]
    #
    # DESCRIPTION
    #   This command creates a new git worktree and optionally creates a new branch for it.
    #   If no branch name is provided, it will create a new branch based on the current
    #   upstream branch (typically origin/main). After creating the worktree, it will
    #   automatically change to the new worktree directory.
    #
    # OPTIONS
    #   -h, --help       Show this help message
    #
    # ARGUMENTS
    #   worktree-name    Name/path of the new worktree directory
    #   branch-name      Name of the branch to create or check out (optional)
    #                   If not provided, creates a branch from upstream
    #   git-worktree-options  Additional options to pass to git worktree add
    #
    # EXAMPLES
    #   # Create worktree 'feature-123' with new branch from upstream
    #   git-wadd feature-123
    #
    #   # Create worktree 'hotfix' based on existing branch 'develop'
    #   git-wadd hotfix develop
    #
    #   # Create worktree with additional git worktree options
    #   git-wadd feature-456 origin/main --force
    #
    #   # Can also be called as git subcommand
    #   git wadd my-feature
